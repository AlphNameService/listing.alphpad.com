* Engagement: The Seven Club aims to unify and highlight the Alephium community across all possible social networks.
* Voting: Seven Club members can vote on governance proposals and thus influence the future direction of the project.

## Origins
On a night in April 2024, at the dawn of the 4th Bitcoin Halving, 12 wandering souls crossed paths in a crypto discussion channel. Brought together by sheer chance, they became more than just participants: a true fraternity of ‘degens’. Each bringing their own spark, they explore together the depths and infinite possibilities of the crypto universe, bound by their shared passion and an unceasing quest for innovation.
